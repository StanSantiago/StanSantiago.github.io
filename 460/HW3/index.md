### Visual Studio 2017
While I used Eclipse briefly to work with the Java code provided, for writing C# I already had Visual Studio 2017 installed as my main IDE for C and C++ (the main language I am experienced in at the time of writing).  This made it easy to just start up a new project and get to work.  I found the project structure of Visual Studio to be perfect for adding new class files, they were integrated immediately upon creation.

Of course, I did not want to have Git push every file in the project, so I made use of Github's VisualStudio.gitignore from their [.gitignore repository.](https://github.com/github/gitignore)  This contains a number of .gitignore templates that make uploading projects from various ides much simpler, skimming off unnecessary files from the upload.

### Translating the Code
Since this assignment had a preexisting code to work off of, most of the labor involved simply referencing it, and making tweeks where needed to accomidate the differences between Java and C#, since of the logic itself used works fine in both languages.  The main difference is that throwing exceptions opperates just a little differently in C#.  When writing my own C# in the future, the logic should be easy to approach, I will just need to remember to use namespace structure, and look up certain built in methods when I do not know them by name.
